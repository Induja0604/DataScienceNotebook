It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.\n\n2. **Pandas**: Pandas is a powerful library for data manipulation and analysis in Python. It offers data structures like DataFrame and Series, which are essential for cleaning, transforming, and analyzing data.\n\n3. **scikit-learn**: scikit-learn is a machine learning library in Python. It provides simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis, implementing a wide range of machine learning algorithms for classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction.\n\n4. **Matplotlib**: Matplotlib is a plotting library for Python. It allows you to create static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. It is often used together with other libraries like NumPy and Pandas for data visualization tasks.\n\n5. **TensorFlow and/or PyTorch**: These are popular libraries for deep learning and neural network-based machine learning tasks. They provide flexible frameworks for building and training machine learning models, especially in areas like natural language processing, image recognition, and reinforcement learning.\n   ",
